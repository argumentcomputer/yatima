# Mutuals

The essential problem is this: Content addressing requires the reference map of declarations to be a directed acyclic graph. **Then, how do we content address mutual (cyclic) declarations?**

## TODO 

Explain how we're doing this after we test and see if it actually works :D

This is sufficiently complicated that we should take some care in writing out how it all works.
