# Contribute to `yatima-lang`

The guidelines to contribute to this repository are:

1. Start by creating an issue that describes what needs to be done. A defined
scope is not only helpful for the contributor but also for the reviewers
2. Assign yourself to the issue you're working on so others can easily find free
issues to start working
3. We use the following branch naming convention:
`<initials>/<issue>-<description>`. Example: `ap/27-create-contributing-md`
4. Expect (and ask for) exactly *one* reviewer. We require an approval before
merging anything, which also helps spreading awareness of what is being changed.
Too many required reviewers creates a bystander effect. Only one official review
is needed and other people should freely comment on as needed
5. This is not mandatory, but very helpful: open an early PR (can be a draft)
and link the issue you're working on. This will help everyone understand why
some branches exist
6. We use "squash and merge" when merging a branch into `main` to keep the
commit history cleaner and more atomic
7. Make sure your branch gets deleted after being merged into `main` so we can
avoid having stale branches causing noise when we search for branches
