# Contribute to `yatima-lang`

The guidelines to contribute to this repository are:

1. Start by creating an issue that describes what needs to be done. A defined scope is not only helpful for the contributor but also for the reviewers
2. Assign yourself to the issue you're working on so others can easily find free issues to start working
3. Expect (and ask for) at least *one* reviewer. We require an approval before merging anything, which also helps spreading awareness of what is being changed
4. This is not mandatory, but very helpful: open an early PR (can be a draft) and link the issue you're working on. This will help everyone understand why some branches exist
5. make sure your branch gets deleted after being merged into `main` so we can avoid having stale branches causing noise when we search for branches
